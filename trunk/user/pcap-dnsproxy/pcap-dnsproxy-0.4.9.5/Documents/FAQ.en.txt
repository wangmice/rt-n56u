* WinPcap could not be installed and show that there is an older version:
  * Please uninstall the older version of WinPcap first. You can find WinPcap in Programs menu or search directories for its uninstaller. WinPcap uninstaller should be located in %PROGRAMFILES(x86)% (64-bit system) or %PROGRAMFILES% (32-bit system).
  * If you cannot find any uninstaller, you can reboot to safe mode and remove all WinPcap files manually:
    * %WINDIR%\system32\Packet.dll
    * %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\npf.sys
    * %WINDIR%\system32\WanPacket.dll
    * %WINDIR%\system32\wpcap.dll
    * %WINDIR%\system32\pthreadVC.dll

* Error message prints when installing, running or restarting service:
  * The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion - Please check if there is an error report generated. For details, please visit the following section below.
  * Service start failed, please check the configuration - Please check if there is an error report generated. For details, please visit the following section below.

* Debug mode
  * When in debug/console mode, all error messages will print to screen directly.
  * Please make sure that there is only one instance running in the same time.
  * Windows
    * Run directly with administrator privileges.

* Service is not running or system settings error, please check if there is an error report generated or visit installation section in ReadMe.
