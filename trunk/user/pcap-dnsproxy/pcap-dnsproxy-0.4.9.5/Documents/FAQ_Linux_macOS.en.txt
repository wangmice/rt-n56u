    forwarding packet loss rate is relatively high, you can try to switch to the TCP 
    protocol mode (see ReadMe document configuration parameters in the detailed description 
    of the base base area of ​​the Operation Mode section) or try to request several times
  * May also be due to a long time running a cumulative error caused by the task force is 
    trying to solve. You can try to restart the service (see the restart service in the 
    ReadMe documentation)
