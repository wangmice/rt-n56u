-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation method (required as administrator):

1. Visit https://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm to download and install WinPcap with administrator privileges
  * WinPcap only need to be installed once, before the latest version of the installation or later update the tool, please start from the second step
  * If the WinPcap prompt has been installed in the old version can not continue, see the FAQ in the run results analysis section
  * The self-starting option during installation has no effect on the operation of the tool. The tool directly calls the WinPcap API without going through the server program

2. Visit https://github.com/chengr28/Pcap_DNSProxy/releases to download the binary executable file to the local
  * Windows version of Pcap_DNSProxy in the binary executable file in the Windows directory, the entire directory can be a separate out of the run

3. Open the downloaded binary executable file, extract the Windows directory to any location on the disk
  * Directory location and program file name can be arbitrarily changed, it is recommended that the project placed in a separate directory
  * The profile needs to use a fixed file name (see the Features and Techniques section below for more details)

4. After determining the name and path of the tool directory, go to the directory and right-click on the administrator (Vista and later) or run the ServiceControl.bat (XP / 2003) by pressing the administrator login twice (XP / 2003)
  * Enter 1 and press Enter, select "1: Install service" to install the service
  * Batch processing will program the system services, and firewall test, each boot service will automatically start
  * At this point, the Windows system asks if you want to agree to programmatically access the network. Please tick "private network" and "public network" and confirm

5. Please follow the following section of the normal work to see the method, the first test whether the normal work and then modify the network settings!

6. Open the Network and Sharing Center - Change Adapter Settings Select either Local or Wireless or Broadband
  * Right-click "Properties" - "Internet Protocol (TCP / IP)" (XP / 2003) or "Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)" (Vista and later) - "Properties" - check "Use the following DNS server Device address "
  * In the "preferred DNS server" fill in "127.0.0.1" (without quotation marks) to determine the save and exit
  * If you need to use the IPv6 protocol for the local server
    * Right click on "Properties" - "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)" - "Properties" - check "Use the following DNS server address"
    * Enter ":: 1" (without the quotation marks) in the "Preferred DNS Server" to confirm the save and exit
  * Make sure to only fill in these two addresses, fill in other addresses may cause the system to select other DNS servers to bypass the program's proxy
  * Note: It is recommended to "local connection" and "wireless connection" and "broadband connection" all modified!

7. Special attention:
  * If you need to let the flow of the program through the system routing level of the agent (such as VPN, etc.) for functional variable name resolution, select one of the options, restart the configuration after the completion of the service:
    * Direct Request = IPv4
    * Direct Request = IPv6
    * Direct Request = IPv4 + IPv6
    * More is the system routing level of the agent will be through the virtual network interface card to connect, then the DNS by the agent to control their own, then do not need to do any operation
  * Configuration file Hosts file IPFilter file and the directory where the error report is located in the above installation method section in step 4 registered service information prevail
    * Do not fill more than 4096 bytes / 4KB
    * File read only supports the entire text of a single encoding and line feed format combination, do not mix the text in the support of the encoding or newline format!
  * Please check whether the address and port of the service are occupied by other programs or other instances of the program before starting the service. Otherwise, the monitoring conflicts may not work properly
  * Anti-virus software / third-party firewall may prevent the operation of the program, please act all allowed or the program to join the white list
  * If the service does not promptly respond to the start or control request, please note that there is an error report generated, detailed error information see FAQ document Error.log detailed error report section
  * The names of directories and programs can be changed at will, but be sure to complete the installation method before step 4. If the path to the tool directory is to be moved after the service is registered, see the precautions in step 2 above.
  * Windows XP If there is a 10022 error, you need to enable the system's IPv6 support (run administrator as an administrator to enter ipv6 install and enter, one-time operation), and then reboot service
  * This project only provides technical support for the latest version, the new version of the release of the old version of the support will immediately stop, please be sure to upgrade to the latest version


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Restart the service method (required as an administrator):
1. Right-click on the administrator (Vista and later) or run the ServiceControl.bat (XP / 2003) by pressing the administrator login twice (XP / 2003)
2. Enter 5 and press Enter, select "5: Restart service" to restart the service immediately


Update the program method (need to be an administrator, do not directly cover, otherwise it may cause unpredictable errors):
1. In advance to download a new version of the Pcap_DNSProxy (that is, the installation method in step 2), the update process may cause the function variable name resolution short interrupt
2. Back up all the custom content of the Hosts file IPFilter file
3. Right-click the ServiceControl.bat as an administrator (Vista and later) or log on as an administrator (XP / 2003)
4. Enter 2 and press Enter to select the "2: Uninstall service" uninstall service
4. Delete the entire Pcap_DNSProxy program directory. Note that Windows Firewall may leave information that allows programs to access the network. After uninstalling the service and changing the program directory, you may need to use the registry cleanup tool to clean up
5. Extract the new version of Pcap_DNSProxy to any location (ie, step 3 of the installation method)
6. Add the customization of the profile to the appropriate area in the new version of the profile
7. Redeploy Pcap_DNSProxy in step 4 of the installation method


How to use it in safe mode (requires an administrator):
* Program has the ability to run in safe mode, in safe mode, right-click as an administrator to run the program directly
* Direct operation mode has a console window, close the program directly close the console window can be


Unload method (required as administrator):
1. Restore the DNS function variable name server address configuration according to step 6 of the installation method
2. Right-click on the administrator (Vista and later) or run the ServiceControl.bat (XP / 2003) by pressing the administrator login (XP / 2003)
  * Enter 2 and press Enter, select "2: Uninstall service" to uninstall the service
  * Note: Windows Firewall may have permission to access the network information, it may need to use the registry cleanup after the clean-up
  * Transfer the tool directory path does not need to uninstall the service, first stop the service transfer, transfer is completed after the restart service


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Normal work View method:

Special use skills:
Here are some of the proposed project group introduction and use of skills for your reference and use. For details on adjusting the configuration, see the section below

* This tool configuration options are rich, configure the different combinations will have different effects, introduce several more commonly used combination:
  * Default configuration: UDP request + capture mode
  * Outgoing Protocol = .. TCP: UDP request after the first request and UDP packet capture mode, the occupation of the network resources is relatively high
    * Because the TCP request most of the time will not be poisoned, this combination of filtering effect is more reliable
  * EDNS Label = 1: Enable EDNS request tag function
    * This function will improve the filtering capacity of the forged data package, the combination of the filter effect is more reliable
  * Change the target server's request port to a non-standard DNS port: for example, OpenDNS supports 53 standard ports and 5353 nonstandard port requests
    * Non-standard DNS port at this stage has not yet been disturbed, this combination of filtering effect is more reliable
  * Multiple Request Times = xx: Apply to all requests except the request server, a request multiple send function
    * This feature is used to combat network packet loss is more serious, the system and network resources are relatively high, but in the case of poor network environment can improve the reliability of the results obtained
  * DNSCurve = 1 simultaneous Encryption = 0: use DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) unencrypted mode request function variable name resolution
    * This combination is equal to the use of non-standard DNS port request, functional variable name resolution is relatively high reliability, see the above
  * DNSCurve = 1 simultaneous Encryption = 1: use DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) encryption mode request function variable name resolution
    * This combination of encrypted transmission of all functional variable name request, function variable name resolution reliability of the highest
  * DNSCurve = 1 simultaneous Encryption = 1 At the same time Encryption Only = 1: only use DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) encryption mode request function variable name resolution
    * The above encryption combination does not prevent the program from request DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) encryption mode failure is to use other protocol request function variable name resolution, open Encryption Only = 1 will only allow the use of encrypted transmission, the highest security and reliability, but Functional variable name resolution success rate may decline
* Optimize the large number of requests under the program performance:
  * Pcap Reading Timeout This parameter allows the packet capture module to crawl the packet at a higher frequency
  * Cache Parameter + Default TTL as much as possible to increase the parameters of the cache can increase the retention time or queue length, increase the cache hit rate
  * Thread Pool Maximum Number This parameter can be increased by increasing the maximum number of buffers that can be requested
  * Queue Limits Reset Time Do not turn on parameters that limit the number of requests
  * Multiple Request Times is extremely harsh, caution, consumes a lot of system resources and will increase the delay


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Function and technology:

* The role of batch processing:
  * The end of the operation will have the results of the operation, the specific need to pay attention to the screen prompts
  * 1: Install service - register the program as a system service and start the program for Windows Firewall test
  * 2: Uninstall service - to stop and uninstall the service of the tool
  * 3: Start service - start the service of the tool
  * 4: Stop service - stop the service of the tool
  * 5: Restart service - restart the service of the tool
  * 6: Flush DNS cache in Pcap_DNSProxy - Refresh the program's internal and system DNS cache
  * 7: Flush DNS cache in system only - Refreshes the system's DNS cache
  * 8: Exit - exit
* The file name supported by the profile (only the higher priority will be read and the lower priority will be ignored):
  * Windows: Config.ini> Config.conf> Config.cfg> Config
  * Linux / macOS: Config.conf> Config.ini> Config.cfg> Config
* Request function variable name resolution precedence
  * Use the system API function to perform the function variable name resolution (mostly): Hosts> Pcap_DNSProxy Hosts entries (Whitelist / whitelist entries> Hosts list)> DNS cache> Local hosts / DNS resolution function variable name list> Remote DNS server
  * Read the DNS server address directly from the web interface card settings Function Variable Name Resolution (small): Pcap_DNSProxy Hosts configuration file (Whitelist / whitelist entry> Hosts list)> DNS cache> Local Hosts / DNS resolution in the country Variable list of names> Remote DNS server
  * Requests the priority of the remote DNS server: Direct Request mode> DNSCurve Encryption / Unencrypted mode of TCP mode (if any)> DNSCurve Encrypted / Unencrypted mode in UDP mode (if any)> TCP mode Normal request (if any )> UDP mode normal request
* The tool's DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) protocol is built-in implementation, do not need to install DNSCrypt official tool!
  * DNSCurve agreement for Streamlined / Lite type
  * Automatically get the connection information must ensure that the system time is correct, otherwise the certificate will lead to failure to get the connection information failed!
  * DNSCrypt official tool will take up the local DNS port caused Pcap_DNSProxy deployment failed!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Profile Details Description:

Valid parameter format is "option name = value / data" (without quotation marks, note the position of the equal sign)
Note: The configuration file will only be restarted at the beginning of the tool service, after modifying the parameters of the file (see the restart service in the Note section above)

Base - the basic parameter area
  * Version - the version of the profile used to correctly identify the profile: this parameter is not related to the program version number, do not modify
  * File Refresh Time - File Refresh Interval: in seconds and a minimum of 5
    * This parameter also determines the sublimation of the time of the monitor's sleep time, which means that it will start for a long period of time and check if there is a need to re-run a specific monitoring project without waiting for a long time to complete the dormant To be able to re-monitor this, the appropriate configuration of this function on the program's network adaptability will be improved
  * Large Buffer Size - Fixed length of the large data buffer: in bytes, with a minimum of 1500
  * Additional Path - additional data file to read the path, attached to the directory path under the Hosts file and IPFilter file will be read in order: Please fill in the directory of the absolute path
    * This parameter supports multiple paths at the same time. Please use | separate between paths
  * Hosts File Name - Hosts file name, attached to the Hosts file name will be read in turn
    * This parameter supports multiple file names at the same time. Please use | separate between paths
  * IPFilter File Name - IPFilter file name, the IPFilter file name attached here will be read in sequence
    * This parameter supports multiple file names at the same time. Please use | separate between paths

* Log - Log parameter area
  * Print Log Level - Specify the log output level: leave blank to 3
    * 0 to disable the log output function
    * 1 for outputting a major error
    * 2 for output general error
    * 3 for outputting all errors
  * Maximum size of log file: Maximum capacity of log file: The unit can be added to the unit, the unit is KB / MB / GB, the acceptable range is 4 KB - 256 MB, if it is blank, 8 MB
    * Note: log file reaches the maximum capacity will be deleted directly, and then re-generate a new log file, the original log will not be able to recover!

* Listen - Listen to parameter areas
  * Process Unique - Process instance uniqueness check switch: On for 1 / off to 0
    * Only one program instance can only be run at the same time
    * When the program is closed, the number of instances will not be checked, the program can run multiple and listen to different combinations of addresses and ports, but the functions that depend on the system's global features will not be available:
      * The address and port combination between different instances can not be repeated, otherwise it will not work because the listening conflict does not work
      * Plug-in parameters --flush-dns (Domain) will not be used, then if you need to clear the program's internal DNS cache, you can edit the profile to change the file modification time
  * Pcap Capture - capturing the function of the main switch, open the packet capture module can be used normally: open to 1 / off to 0
    * Note: If the packet capture module is closed, it will automatically open the Direct Request function, enable Direct Request on the DNS poisoning pollution defensive ability is relatively weak
  * Pcap Devices Blacklist - Specifies that the network interface card containing this string will be ignored by capturing the network interface card containing this name, name or description
    * This parameter supports the designation of multiple names, case insensitive, formatted as "the name of the web interface card (name of the web interface card)" (without quotation marks, optional items in brackets)
    * The name or profile obtained from the system by the packet capture module is not necessarily the same as that shown by other network setup programs
  * Pcap Reading Timeout - Packet capture time, packets will only be read after waiting for a timeout, and the remaining time packets are in hibernation: in milliseconds, with a minimum of 10
    * Read the timeout time need to balance the demand and resource consumption, the time set too long will lead to the domain name resolution request response slow response request timeout, too fast will take up too much system to deal with resources
  * Listen Protocol - the protocol supported by the local listening request: can be filled with IPv4 and IPv6 and TCP and UDP
    * Fill in the agreement can be arbitrarily combined, only fill IPv4 or IPv6 with UDP or TCP, only listen to the specified agreement of the local port
    * Note: The agreement here refers to the protocol that can be used when request the function variable name resolution, and the protocol used by the program request the remote DNS server is determined by the Protocol parameter
  * Listen Port - the port of the listening port, the local listening request: the format "port A (| port B)" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
    * Port can be filled in the service name, service name list see below
    * Can also fill in the port between 1-65535, if left to 53
    * When multiple ports are filled in, the program will listen for requests at the same time
    * When the corresponding agreement Listen Address takes effect, this parameter of the corresponding agreement will be automatically ignored
  * Operation Mode - Program monitoring mode: Server / Server mode, Private / private network mode and Proxy / proxy mode
    * Server / server mode: Open the DNS port (TCP / UDP open at the same time), for all other devices to provide proxy function variable name resolution request service
    * Private / private network mode: open the DNS port (TCP / UDP open at the same time), can only be limited to the private network address of the device to provide proxy function variable name resolution request service
    * Proxy / proxy mode: only open the loopback address of the DNS port (TCP / UDP open at the same time), only for the machine to provide proxy function variable name resolution request service
    * Custom / custom mode: open the DNS port (TCP / UDP open at the same time), the available address determined by the IPFilter parameters
    * When the corresponding agreement Listen Address takes effect, this parameter of the corresponding agreement will be automatically ignored
  * IPFilter Type - IPFilter parameter type: divided into Deny prohibited and Permit allowed, corresponding to the application of IPFilter parameters for the blacklist or white list
  * IPFilter Level - IPFilter parameter filtering level, the higher the level of the more stringent filtering, and IPFilter entries corresponding to: 0 is not enabled for filtering, if left to 0
  * Accept Type - Disables or allows only requests for DNS types listed in the format "Deny: DNS record name or ID (name or ID of DNS record)" or "Permit: DNS record name or ID (| DNS record Name or ID) "(without quotation marks, optional items in parentheses), list of all available DNS types:

* DNS - function variable name resolution parameter area
  * Outgoing Protocol - the protocol used to send the request to the remote DNS server: can be filled with IPv4 and IPv6 and TCP and UDP
    * Fill in the agreement can be arbitrarily combined, only fill IPv4 or IPv6 with UDP or TCP, only use the specified agreement to the remote DNS server to issue a request
    * When you fill in both IPv4 and IPv6 or do not fill in any network layer agreements, the program will automatically select the protocol to be used according to the web environment
    * At the same time fill in TCP and UDP is equal to only fill in TCP because UDP is the standard network layer protocol for DNS, so even when the TCP fails to fill the UDP request
    * Fill in Force TCP to prevent TCP requests from failing to use UDP to retry requests
  * Direct Request - Direct connection mode, enable the system will use the system directly request the remote server: can fill in IPv4 and IPv6 and 0, turn off to 0
    * It is recommended when the system uses the global proxy function, the program will be in addition to all the requests outside the domestic server directly to the system without any filtering and other processing, the system will automatically send the request to the remote server for analysis
    * When you fill in IPv4 or IPv6, you will enable the Direct Request function of the corresponding protocol. Filling in IPv4 + IPv6 will enable all protocol functions
  * Cache Type - the type of DNS cache: sub-Timer / Chrono, Queue / Queue type and their mixed type, fill in 0 to turn off this feature
    * Timer / Timing: DNS buffers that exceed the specified time will be discarded
    * Queue / Queue: When the queue length is exceeded, the oldest DNS cache is deleted
    * Blending type: When the specified time is exceeded and the queue length is exceeded, the oldest DNS cache is deleted
  * Cache Type - the type of DNS cache: sub-Timer / Chrono, Queue / Queue type and their mixed type, fill in 0 to turn off this feature
    * Timer / Timing: DNS buffers that exceed the specified time will be discarded
    * Queue / Queue: When the queue length is exceeded, the oldest DNS cache is deleted
    * Mixed type: When the specified time is exceeded, the oldest DNS cache is deleted when the queue length is exceeded and the TTL of the function variable itself is exceeded
  * Cache Parameter - DNS cache parameters: sub-Timer / Chrono, Queue / Queue type and their mixed type, fill in 0 to turn off this feature
    * Timer / Timing type
      * Cache time in seconds
      * If the average TTL value of the resolution result is greater than this value, use [TTL + this value] for the final cache time
      * If the average TTL value of the resolution result is less than or equal to this value, use [this value] as the final cache time
      * If you fill 0, the final cache time is TTL
    Queue / Queue: Queue Length
    * Mixed type
      * Queue length
      * The final cache time in this mode is determined by the Default TTL parameter
  * Cache Single IPv4 Address Prefix - IPv4 protocol Separate DNS cache queue address used by the length: the unit is the bit, the maximum is 32 to fill in 0 to turn off this feature
    * All requests at private addresses are not controlled by this parameter and have a default cache queue
  * Cache Single IPv6 Address Prefix - IPv6 protocol Separate DNS cache queue address used by the length: the unit is bit, up to 128 fill in 0 to turn off this feature
    * All requests at private addresses are not controlled by this parameter and have a default cache queue
  * Default TTL - cached DNS record default retention time: in seconds, left for 900 seconds / 15 minutes
    * When the DNS cache type is mixed, this parameter will determine the final cache time
      * If the average TTL value of the resolution result is greater than this value, use [TTL + this value] for the final cache time
      * If the average TTL value of the resolution result is less than or equal to this value, use [this value] as the final cache time
      * If you fill 0, the final cache time is TTL
  
* Local DNS - Domestic function variable name resolution parameter area
  * Local Protocol - the protocol used to send the request to the domestic DNS server: can be filled with IPv4 and IPv6 and TCP and UDP
    * Fill in the agreement can be arbitrarily combined, only fill IPv4 or IPv6 with UDP or TCP, only use the specified agreement to the domestic DNS server to issue a request
    * When you fill in both IPv4 and IPv6 or do not fill in any network layer agreements, the program will automatically select the protocol to be used according to the web environment
    * At the same time fill in TCP and UDP is equal to only fill in TCP because UDP is the standard network layer protocol for DNS, so even when the TCP fails to fill the UDP request
    * Fill in Force TCP to prevent TCP requests from failing to use UDP to retry requests
  * Local Hosts - White List Local Server Request Function: On 1 / Off to 0
    * This feature will not attempt to read the data in the Local Hosts whitelist and will not read any whitelist data when it is closed
  * Local Routing - Local routing table recognition function: On is 1 / off is 0
    * After this function is enabled, all requests will be sent to the local server for functional variable name resolution, and then according to the results of the next analysis of the operation
  * Local Force Request - Forced use of the domestic server for resolution: On for 1 / off to 0
    * This feature requires that the Local Hosts parameter be enabled
  * Note: A description of the combination of Local Force Request and Local Hosts and Local Routing
    * When all parameters are off: skip the process of using the domestic server to perform functional variable name resolution
    * The next step in the case of server resolution failure will proceed to the next step
    * Only when Local Hosts is enabled: will be followed by the (black) white list (none) hit the function variable name of the rule before it can be resolved using the domestic server
    * When the Local Force Request parameter is on, the function variable of the forced hit rule can only be resolved using the domestic server
      * Only when Local Routing is enabled: all requests are sent to the local server for function variable name resolution, and then match according to the routing table, the result of the hit routing table will be returned directly to the requestor
    * When both Local Hosts and Local Routing are enabled, all requests (except those specified by the blacklist) are sent to the local server for functional variable name resolution, and then match according to the routing table. The result of the hit routing table will be returned directly to Requester
      * When the Local Force Request parameter is on, the function variable of the forced hit rule can only be resolved using the domestic server

* Addresses - normal mode address area
  * IPv4 Listen Address - IPv4 local listening address: need to enter a port format with the address, leave it blank
    * Supports multiple addresses
    * The Operation Mode and Listen Port parameters of the IPv4 protocol will be automatically ignored when this value is entered
  * IPv4 EDNS Client Subnet Address - IPv4 user subnet address, after the input will be added to all requests for this address EDNS subnet information: need to enter a prefix with the length of the local public network address, leave blank Enabled
    * This feature requires the EDNS Label parameter to be enabled
    * EDNS Client Subnet Relay parameter priority is higher than this parameter. After enabling, the EDNS subnet address of EDNS Client Subnet Relay will be added preferentially.
    * The RFC standard recommends that the IPv4 address has a first code length of 24 bits and an IPv6 address of 56 bits
  * IPv4 Main DNS Address - IPv4 primary DNS server address: need to enter a port format with the address, leave it blank

Hosts File Format Description:

The Hosts profile is divided into multiple areas that provide different functions
* The area is identified by the label, and it is not deleted when it is modified
* The total length of an entry must not exceed 4096 bytes / 4KB
* Need to be added Please add # / pound sign at the beginning of the entry
* The priority order is reduced from top to bottom, the higher the priority of the entry
* Parallel Hosts entry support quantity is determined by the requested function variable name and EDNS Payload length, no more than 75 A records or 43 AAAA records


* Whitelist - whitelist entry
  * This type of entry lists the required functional variable names that will directly bypass Hosts without using the Hosts feature
  * Valid parameter format is "NULL regular expression" (without quotation marks)
  * Attention to priority issues, such as an area with a whitelist entry:

    NULL. * \. Test \ .test
    127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.2. 127.0.0.3. * \. Test

  * Although. * \. Test contains. * \. Test \ .test but because of the priority order from top to bottom decrement, so first hit. * \. Test \ .test and return to the use of remote server resolution
  * Thus bypassing the following entry, do not use the function of Hosts


* Whitelist Extended - white list entry extension function
  * This type of entry also supports specific types of functions that conform to the rules. Variable name requests that directly bypass Hosts will not use the Hosts feature
  * Valid parameter format is "NULL: DNS type (| DNS type) Regular expression" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
  * Only allow specific types of function variable name request, valid parameter format is "NULL (Permit): DNS type (| DNS type) Regular expression" (without quotation marks)

    NULL: A | AAAA. * \. Test \ .test
    NULL (Deny): NS | SOA. * \. Test

  * The first is to skip the A record of the matching rule and the function variable name request of the AAAA record. Other types of requests are matched rules
  * And the second only matches the NS record of the rule and the function variable name request for the SOA record, and the other type of request is skipped directly

* Banned - blacklist entry
  * This type of entry lists the required function variable name will directly return to the function variable name does not exist function, to avoid redirection caused by the problem
  * Valid parameter format is "BANNED regular expression" (without quotation marks)
  * Note the priority of the problem, for example, there is a blacklist entry area:

    Banned. * \. Test \ .test
    127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.2. 127.0.0.3. * \. Test

  *. * \. Test contains. * \. Test \ .test but because of the priority from top to bottom decrement, so the first hit. *. Test.test and directly return function variable name does not exist
  * Thus bypassing the following entry to achieve the purpose of the mask function variable name


* Banned Extended - blacklist entry extension function
  * This type of entry also supports the ability to mask or release a specific type of function name request that conforms to the rule
  * Valid parameter format is "BANNED: DNS type (| DNS type) Regular expression" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
  * Only the specific type of function variable name request is allowed. The valid parameter format is "BANNED (Permit): DNS type (| DNS type) Regular expression" (without quotation marks, optional items in parentheses)

    BANNED: A | AAAA. * \. Test \ .test
    BANNED (Permit): NS | SOA. * \. Test

  * The first is the mask record of the matching rule and the AAAA record of the domain name request, other types of requests are released
  * And the second is only the release of the rules of the NS records and SOA records of the domain name request, other types of requests are blocked


* Hosts / CNAME Hosts - Main Hosts List / CNAME Hosts List
  * The main difference between the main Hosts list and the CNAME Hosts list is that the scope of the role is different. The scope of the former is the received function variable name resolution request, which is the received function variable name resolution result
    * Valid parameter format is "Address (| address A | address B) Function variable name of the regular formula" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items, pay attention to the location of the interval)
  * According to the source address Hosts list, according to the received function variable name resolution request source address to determine whether the need for Hosts
    * The valid parameter format is "Source Address / Front Length (| Source Address A / Front Length A | Source Address B / Front Length B) -> Address (Address A | Address B) Function Variable name of the regular formula "(without quotation marks, brackets are optional items, pay attention to the location of the interval)
  * The interval between the address and the regular expression can be a space / half space or HT / level positioning symbol, the interval length is not limited, but do not enter the full space
  * An entry can only accept a URL type (IPv4 / IPv6), if the same function variable name needs to be IPv4 / IPv6 Hosts, please divided into two entry input
  * The principle of parallel address for a return to multiple records, and the specific use of which records by the requestor, usually for the first
  * For example, there is a valid data area under [Hosts]:

    127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.3. * \. Test \ .test
    127.0.0.4 | 127.0.0.5 | 127.0.0.6. * \. Test
    :: 1 | :: 2 | :: 3. * \. Test \ .test
    :: 4 | :: 5 | :: 6. * \. Test

  *. * \. Test contains. * \. Test \ .test but because of the priority order from top to bottom down, so the first hit. *. Test \. Test and direct return, no other checks
    * Request to parse xxx.test A record (IPv4) will return 127.0.0.4, 127.0.0.5 and 127.0.0.6
    * Request to parse xxx.test AAAA records (IPv6) will return :: 4, :: 5 and :: 6
    * Request to parse xxx.test.test A record (IPv4) will return 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2 and 127.0.0.3
    * Request to parse xxx.test.test for AAAA records (IPv6) will return :: 1, :: 2 and :: 3

* Local Hosts - Active DNS resolution function variable name list
This area is used to improve the access speed by using the DNS server resolution for the function variable name. Please make sure that the DNS server address is not empty during use (see the section above for details of the configuration file)
Valid parameter format is "regular expression" (without quotation marks)
  * To use this feature, you must open the Local Hosts option in the profile!
  * This function does not filter any DNS server response in the country. Please make sure that the information entered in this area will not be disturbed by DNS poisoning
  * For example, there is a [Local Hosts] valid data area:

    . * \. Test \ .test
    . * \. Test

  * All functional variable name requests that conform to the above regular expressions will be resolved using the domestic DNS server


* Address Hosts - parse the results address of the other list
  * The region data is used to replace the addresses in the resolution results, providing more accurate Hosts customization capabilities
  * Target address area support Use the network header format to replace the header data of the address in the resolution based on the specified prefix length
    * When using the network header format, the first destination address entry must specify the prefix length, and the other destination address can be omitted or written.
    * After the network header format is specified, it will be applied to all target addresses. Note that the entire entry can only specify the same prefix length
  * For example, there is a valid data area under [Address Hosts]:

    127.0.0.1 | 127.0.0.2 127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255
    255.255.255.255/24 255.254.253.252
    :: 1 :: - :: FFFF
    FFFF: EEEE :: / 64 | FFFF: EEEE :: FFFF :: EEEE | ​​FFFF :: EEEF-FFFF :: FFFF

  * Resolution of the address range of 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 will be replaced by 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.0.2
  * The resolution of the result is 255.254.253.252 when the address is replaced by 255.255.255.252
  * The resolution of the address range is: to :: FFFF will be replaced by :: 1
  * FFFF :: EEEE or FFFF :: EEEF: EFFF :: EEEF to FFFF: :: EEEE or FFFF: EEEE :: xxxx: xxxx: xxxx: xxxx

* Stop - temporarily stop reading the label
  * Add "[Stop End]" (without quotation marks) before adding "[Stop]" and data to stop reading the data.
  * Temporary stop reading after the entry into force need to temporarily stop reading the end of the label or other labels will not start reading again
  * For example, there is a piece of information area:

    [Hosts]
    [Stop]
    127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.2 | 127.0.0.3. * \. Test \ .test
    127.0.0.4 | 127.0.0.5 | 127.0.0.6. * \. Test
    [Stop End]
    :: 1 | :: 2 | :: 3. * \. Test \ .test
    :: 4 | :: 5 | :: 6. * \. Test

    [Local Hosts]
    . * \. Test \ .test
    . * \. Test

  * From the [Stop] line, the following to the [Stop End] between the data will not be read
  * The actual valid data area is:

    [Hosts]
    :: 1 | :: 2 | :: 3. * \. Test \ .test
    :: 4 | :: 5 | :: 6. * \. Test

    [Local Hosts]
    . * \. Test \ .test
    . * \. Test


* Dnsmasq Address - Dnsmasq compatible address format
  * Address Compatible format for Hosts / CNAME Hosts - Main Hosts List / CNAME Hosts List
  * Valid parameter format:
    * First code support --ADDRESS = / or --Address = / or --address = / or ADDRESS = / or Address = / or address = /
    * Normal function Variable name String match mode is "Address = / function variable name suffix / (address)" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items), function variable name suffix If only fill in "#" It means matching all function variable names
    * Regular expression mode is "Address = /: Regular expression: / (address)" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
    * If the address part is left blank, it is equivalent to Banned - blacklist entry
  * For example, the following [Hosts] entry is exactly equivalent:

    Address = /:. * \ Btest: /127.0.0.1
    Address = / test / 127.0.0.1

  * Match all functional variable names to resolve the results to :: 1

    Address = / # / :: 1

  * On the rules of the function of the variable name return function variable name does not exist information

    Address = / test /


* Dnsmasq Server - Dnsmasq compatible server format
  * To use this feature, you must open the Local Hosts option in the profile!
  * Server compatibility format for Local Hosts - List of DNS resolution variables in the territory
  * Valid parameter format:
    * First code support - SERVER = / or --Server = / or --server = / or SERVER = / or Server = / or server = /
    * Common function variable name string match mode is "Server = / (function variable name suffix) / (specify the DNS address to resolve (# port))" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
    * Regular operation mode is "Server = / (: regular expression:) / (specify the DNS address to resolve (# port))" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items)
    * Function variable name suffix or: regular expression: part of the blank is not filled, the equivalent of matching does not meet the standard function variable name, for example, nothing.
    * Specifies that the DNS address part of the parsing is empty if it is left, which is equivalent to using the default DNS server specified by the program profile
    * Specifies that the DNS address part of the resolution is only filled with "#" equivalent to Whitelist - whitelist entry
  * For example, the following [Local Hosts] entry is exactly equivalent:

    Server = /:. * \ Btest: / :: 1 # 53
    Server = / test / :: 1

  * The function variable name that conforms to the rule is parsed using the default DNS server specified by the program profile

    Server = / test /

  * Does not meet the standard function variable name all sent to 127.0.0.1 for analysis

    Server = // 127.0.0.1

IPFilter File Format Description:

IPFilter profiles are divided into blacklist / blacklist area and IPFilter / address filtering area and Local Routing / internal routing table area
* The area is identified by the label, and it is not deleted when it is modified
* The total length of an entry must not exceed 4096 bytes / 4KB
* Need to be added Please add # / pound sign at the beginning of the entry


* Blacklist - Blacklist area
When the Blacklist Filter is on, it will check the list of this function variable name and resolution results, if the resolution contains a function variable name corresponding to the blacklist address, it will directly discard the resolution
Valid parameter format is "address (| address A | address B) regular expression" (without quotation marks, brackets are optional items, pay attention to the location of the interval)
  * The interval between the address and the regular expression can be a space / half space or HT / level positioning symbol, the interval length is not limited, but do not enter the full space
  * An entry can only accept a URL type (IPv4 / IPv6), if the same function variable name need to simultaneously IPv4 / IPv6 address filtering, divided into two entry input


* IPFilter - address filtering area
Address Filtering Blacklist or whitelist is determined by the IPFilter Type value of the profile, Deny forbidden / blacklist and Permit allowed / whitelist
The valid parameter format is "Start Address - End Address, Filter Level, Entry Profile Comment" (without quotation marks)
  * Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but separate two entries when filling out


* Local Routing - the internal routing table area
When Local Routing is on, it will check whether the routing table of this list is hit. Check whether it is related to whether the function name request is using the local server. If the routing table is hit, the result will be returned directly. The hit will discard the resolution result and The server initiates the request again
Valid parameter format is "Address block / network prefix length" (without quotation marks)
  * This routing table supports IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
  * The IPv4 prefix is ​​in the range of 1-32, and the network prefix is ​​in the range of 1-128


* Stop - temporarily stop reading the label
  * For more information, see the introduction to this function
