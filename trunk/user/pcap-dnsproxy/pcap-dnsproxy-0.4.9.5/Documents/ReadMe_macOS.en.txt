-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation method (compile binary executable file):

1. Prepare the program compilation environment
  * Homebrew can be accessed at https://brew.sh
  * CMake can be accessed at https://cmake.org or via Homebrew
  * LibPcap can be accessed at http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-release
    * When decompressing LibPcap dependencies, you can skip compiling and installing dependencies and tools in the following table. For details, see below.
    * Get root permission after use. / Configure -> make -> make install can be
  * Libsodium can be accessed at https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
    * If you are depriving Libsodium dependencies, you can skip compiling and installing dependencies and tools in the following table. For details, see below.
    * After getting the root permission, go to the directory and run ./autogen.sh -> ./configure -> make -> make install
  * OpenSSL is available at https://www.openssl.org
    * If you peel off the OpenSSL dependency, you can skip the compilation and installation of the following dependencies and tools, as described in the following, not recommended
    * Get root permission after use. / Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc -> make -> make install

2. Compile the Pcap_DNSProxy program and configure the program properties
  * Do not change the script's newline format (UNIX / LF)
  * Note: For questions about the TLS / SSL protocol-related features, please refer to the following notes on the OpenSSL library
  * Use the terminal to enter the Source / Auxiliary / Scripts directory, use chmod 755 CMake_Build.sh to get the script to execute the license
  * Execute the compiler using ./CMake_Build.sh
    * What the script does:
      * CMake will compile and generate the Pcap_DNSProxy program in the Release directory
      * Copy the required scripts and default profiles from the ExampleConfig directory and the Scripts directory to the Release directory and set the basic read and write executable permissions
  * Use the ./CMake_Build.sh script to provide the parameters:
    * Executed using ./CMake_Build.sh --disable-libpcap Depends on LibPcap dependencies, deprecated
      * Will not require LibPcap library support after peeling
      * After stripping the program will be completely lost support LibPcap function, and the operation will not produce any error, caution!
    * Execution use ./CMake_Build.sh --disable-libsodium Depends on Libsodium dependencies, deprecated
      * Will not require the support of the Libs sink library after compilation
      * After the spin-off program will be completely lost support DNSCurve (DNSCrypt) protocol function, and the operation will not produce any error, caution!
    * Execution is used ./CMake_Build.sh --disable-tls can be stripped of dependencies on OpenSSL, deprecated
      * Sketch will not require the OpenSSL library after skimming
      * After the spin-off program will completely lose support TLS / SSL agreement function, and the operation will not produce any error, caution!
    * Execution is used ./CMake_Build.sh --disable-tls can be stripped of dependencies on OpenSSL, deprecated
      * Sketch will not require the OpenSSL library after skimming
      * After the spin-off program will completely lose support TLS / SSL agreement function, and the operation will not produce any error, caution!
  * Special instructions for the OpenSSL library:
  

3. Follow the instructions in step 3 of the installation method (using the compiled binary executable).

Special notes about the OpenSSL library:

* After installing the new version of the OpenSSL library for the system, undef: OPENSSL .. error when compiling TLS / SSL functionality:
  * The reason is that macOS comes with the OpenSSL series version is very old (0.9.8) does not support the new version of the feature, the link in the link using the system comes with the library error
  * At this point, look at the records of the compilation process, write down the OpenSSL library directory found by CMake, which Found OpenSSL indicates, and confirm that the version
  * You can edit the CMakeLists.txt file in the Pcap_DNSProxy directory:
    * Please be sure to pay attention to the issue of quotation marks, you must use the ASCII standard quotation marks
    * Find the find_package (OpenSSL REQUIRED) statement and open another line
    * Fill in the new line in the set (CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "$ {CMAKE_EXE_LINK_ERAG_US) - L just recorded directory") priority to specify the link found by the library
    * For example set (CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "$ {CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -L / usr / local / lib")
    * Save the file and re-run ./CMake_Build.sh can
* By default, the OpenSSL library does not contain any trusted root certificate library, the first time you need to use the user to add:
  * Open the utility - keychain access - system root certificate, select all the certificates in the list to cert.pem the PEM format to export to any location
  * Open the terminal, use sudo-i to get the root permission and enter the directory just exported location
  * Use the mv cert.pem certificate target directory /cert.pem to move the system root certificate to the archive to OpenSSL's certificate directory
  * The certificate destination directory here is located near the OpenSSL library deployment directory found by CMake as described above for the Found OpenSSL directive. There should be a subdirectory named certs in the directory
  * For example mv cert.pem / usr / local / ssl


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reboot service method:
1. Open the terminal, use sudo -i to get the root permission and go to the / Library / LaunchDaemons directory
2. Use the launchctl unload pcap_dnsproxy.service.plist to stop the service, wait a while
3. Use launchctl load pcap_dnsproxy.service.plist to start the service


Update the program method (do not overwrite it directly, otherwise it may cause unpredictable errors):
1. Open the terminal, use sudo -i to obtain root permissions and enter the macOS directory
2. Execute the service uninstall script using ./macOS_Uninstall.sh
3. Back up all profiles and delete all Pcap_DNSProxy dependencies
4. Redeploy Pcap_DNSProxy by installation method
  * Restore the backup configuration file to the macOS directory before proceeding to step 4
  * Config.conf file is recommended to be reset according to the backup profile, such as direct coverage may lead to no new features


Uninstall method:
1. Restore the system network settings
2. Open the terminal, use sudo -i to obtain root permissions and enter the macOS directory
3. Execute the service uninstall script using ./macOS_Uninstall.sh
  * What the script does: stop and uninstall the daemon service, remove the plist profile
4. Remove all Pcap_DNSProxy dependencies
