Homebrew formulae are simple Ruby scripts:

Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local
Homebrew won’t install files outside its prefix, and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.

Creating a Homebrew package is done with the command: brew create https://foo.com/bar-1.0.tgz 

The website says "It's all git and ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates."
